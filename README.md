## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Given the incongruencies between the stock market valuation and touchpoints with people in my life, I was interested in performing an analysis to ground the extent of which the pandemic has affected the US population. The discussion of my analysis can be found on Medium, and includes dissections of the US population on the following issues:

1. Income and wealth gap
2. Household savings
3. Consumer debt
4. Impact of COVID-19 shutdowns

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of my analysis can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to government agencies that collected and made this data available to me, including x, y, and z. Feel free to share your thoughts or ideas on how I can improve my analysis or presentation of my findings.
